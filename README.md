### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea
- User reviews and map on first page.

## Testing 


If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

- My website was taking very long time to load so I had to convert and compress all my photos in order to make it work. 
- I wasn able to align my gallery pictures so I learnt how to sue display boxes and made it work on mobiles as well.
- While creating and website and deploying I found out I Needesd to remove the "/" from my links cause it was causing an error while trying to open images through absolute paths.
